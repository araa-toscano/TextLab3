The fact that this time Znayka did not see a rocket through the window had some strange effect on him. He had a feeling that everything that had happened before - and the discovery of the moonstone, and the discovery of weightlessness, and the construction of an interplanetary ship - all this had happened in a dream, and now, when awakening came, everything disappeared, as if nothing had happened. Of course, this feeling occurred to the Expert only for a moment, since he did not allow the thought that the dream could be so long and bright. After making sure that his eyes had not deceived him, he realized that the rocket could simply have fallen to the ground from the wind or from some kind of ground vibration. Jumping out of the room immediately, he ran down the stairs in an instant and rushed to the gate.
